# Design Patterns in Ruby

Summary of the design patterns explained in the book [Design Patterns in Ruby](http://designpatternsinruby.com/), where [Russ Olsen](http://russolsen.com/) explains and adapts to Ruby 14 of the original 23 GoF design patterns.

## Design Patterns

* [Template Method](template_method.md): redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure
* [Strategy](strategy.md): varies part of an algorithm at runtime
* [Observer](observer.md): helps building a highly integrated system, maintainable and avoids coupling between classes
* [Composite](composite.md): builds a hierarchy of tree objects and interacts with all them the same way
* [Iterator](iterator.md): provides a way to access a collection of sub-objects without exposing the underlaying representation
* [Command](command.md): performs some specific task without having any information about the receiver of the request
